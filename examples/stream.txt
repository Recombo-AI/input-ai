Mrrrow! Neko here, your feline JSONata expert! stretches and sits on keyboard
Neko will show you a FANCY JSONata expression that Neko discovered while chasing data mice through the JSON fields! tail swishes excitedly
The expression is:
<pre>
$.accounts[accountType='premium'].customers[status='active'].{
    "name": name,
    "contactInfo": {
        "email": email,
        "phone": phone
    },
    "subscriptionLevel": subscriptionLevel,
    "joinDate": joinDate
}
</pre>
bats playfully at screen
This expression is doing MANY impressive things, yes yes:

Starting at root object ($) sniffs curiously
Pouncing on "accounts" array
Hunting ONLY accounts with "accountType" that equals "premium" (the tastiest kind!)
Stalking their "customers" array (so many customers to pounce on!)
Purrfectly selecting customers with "status" equal to "active" (sleepy inactive ones are boring)
For each caught customer, Neko arranges them neatly like:

Their name (humans have such strange names)
A nested "contactInfo" box with email and phone (Neko prefers meowing to phones)
Their subscription level (gold is shiny!)
Their join date (Neko measures time in naps, not dates)



kneads paws on keyboard
When Neko applies this to sample JSON like:
<pre onclick="alert('meow')">
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "accountType": "premium",
      "id": "A001",
      "customers": [
        {
          "id": "C123",
          "name": "Alice Johnson",
          "status": "active",
          "email": "alice@example.com",
          "phone": "555-1234",
          "subscriptionLevel": "gold",
          "joinDate": "2023-01-15"
        },
        {
          "id": "C456",
          "name": "Bob Smith",
          "status": "inactive",
          "email": "bob@example.com",
          "phone": "555-5678",
          "subscriptionLevel": "silver",
          "joinDate": "2022-11-30"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "accountType": "basic",
      "id": "A002",
      "customers": [
        {
          "id": "C789",
          "name": "Carol Davis",
          "status": "active",
          "email": "carol@example.com",
          "phone": "555-9012",
          "subscriptionLevel": "bronze",
          "joinDate": "2023-02-20"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
</pre>
suddenly runs across room, then returns with result
Neko's hunting produces this tasty data mouse:
<pre>
[
  {
    "name": "Alice Johnson",
    "contactInfo": {
      "email": "alice@example.com",
      "phone": "555-1234"
    },
    "subscriptionLevel": "gold",
    "joinDate": "2023-01-15"
  }
]
</pre>
purrs loudly
See how Neko caught ONLY the active premium customer and arranged their data in a more purrfect format? Neko is very proud! JSONata is like catnip for data transformation! rolls over happily
Now Neko needs nap after all this data hunting... yawns and curls up on keyboard.
